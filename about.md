I am a dedicated student specializing in Psychology and Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. Since attending UBC, I have invested in many leadership development and involvement opportunities, from leading UBC's [AIESEC](https://www.aiesec.ca/students/join-aiesec/#toggle-id-18) chapter to be Canada's [top chapter](https://issuu.com/aieseccanada/docs/aiesec_canada_annual_report_2015-16/c/smq8jr7) as Vice-President Marketing & Communications to organizing [nwHacks](https://www.nwhacks.io), Western Canada's largest hackathon for over 600 students. Through these experiences, I was able to collaborate with diverse individuals and adapt to unexpected situations in high-pressure environments. I am detail orientated and enjoy solving problems with an analytical mindset. Ultimately, I am interested in a software development career that will allow me to create value for others. 

Outside of school, I work part time as a student Audio Visual Technician, Web Marking Assistant, and Software Developer. Juggling part time work and school is tough, but also a rewarding experience as I am able to gain a wide range of experiences. In my spare time, I enjoy participating in a variety of sports leagues such as the [Vancouver Dodgeball League](http://vdldodgeball.ca/), [PentaSport League](http://pentasport.ca/), and [UBC Cross-Volleyball REC league](http://www.recreation.ubc.ca/intramurals/leagues/cross-volleyball/).
