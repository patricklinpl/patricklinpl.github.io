I am a dedicated student specializing in Psychology and Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. Since attending UBC, I have invested in many leadership development and involvement opportunities, from leading UBC's AIESEC chapter to be Canada's top chapter as Vice-President Marketing & Communications to organizing nwHacks, Western Canada's largest hackathon for over 600 students. Through these experiences, I was able to collaborate with diverse individuals and adapt to unexpected situations in high-pressure environments. I am detail orientated and enjoy solving problems with an analytical mindset. Ultimately, I am interested in a software development career that will allow me to create  value for others. 

Outside of school, I work part time as a student Audio Visual Technician, Web Marking Assistant, and Software Developer. These experiences has enabled me to work in a variety of team environments and has allowed me to collaborate with others in a team environment. In my spare time, I enjoy participating in a variety of sports leagues such as the Vancouver/Richmond Dodgeball League, PentaSport League, and UBC Cross-Volleyball REC league.
